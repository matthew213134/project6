  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  
  <h2>A place I would like to visit.</h2>
  <p> I would like to visit London England because from movies I have seen the people there seem angry and I think I would fit right in. Also, it rains there a lot so I would like that also.</p>

  <--!Comments I think I spaced everything out evenly.-->
  
  <h2>A person I admire</h2>
  
  <p> Someone I admire very much probably would be Mike Tyson. First of all, he's survived the world with that terrible lisp he has. But he also became the youngest Lineal Heavyweight champion in the boxing world while being the smallest guy in the division.
